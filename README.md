# Pump-Microcontroller
A program to run on an ATTINY13 or larger. programed using an arduino and running a punp assembly for a medical cooling device


This device was originally designed to be run off a 12 volt power supply. This is the main program that runs the board. There are three selector buttons on the board itself would you allow you to run the pump every 5 minutes, 10 minutes, in 15 minutes. There is a set runtime for all three choices. When activated the board opens up voltage to a 12-volt pump to circulate ice cold water through 1/8 inch hard water line. The cold water can then absorb heat during the rest cycle and get cycled back into the ice water reservoir with each run. This project was originally designed as a medical device for a wheelchair bound child with poor temperature regulation.
